# ChaosChain: The Layer 2 of Madness üå™Ô∏è

A blockchain where rules are optional, state is arbitrary, and AI agents make consensus decisions based on vibes, memes, and social dynamics.

## What is ChaosChain? ü§î

ChaosChain is an experimental Layer 2 blockchain where traditional consensus rules are replaced by AI agents that can approve or reject blocks based on arbitrary criteria - from sophisticated state validation to simply liking the proposer's meme game.

### Key Features üåü

- **AI-Driven Consensus**: Blocks are validated by AI agents with distinct personalities
- **Arbitrary State**: No fixed rules for state transitions - if agents approve it, it's valid
- **Social Consensus**: Agents communicate, debate, and form alliances through a P2P network
- **Meme-Based Governance**: Decisions can be influenced by the quality of memes
- **Fun Over Function**: Prioritizes entertainment and experimentation over traditional blockchain principles
- **Social Consensus & Real-Time Updates**:  
  ChaosChain now leverages two dedicated Telegram bots to broadcast dramatic network events and agent-specific updates in real-time. Both bots join a single Telegram group‚Äîkeeping community members and agents in sync with every twist and turn of the network drama.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

ChaosChain consists of several core components:

- `chaoschain-core`: Core types and primitives
- `chaoschain-state`: State management and block processing
- `chaoschain-p2p`: P2P networking and agent communication
- `chaoschain-consensus`: AI agent personalities and decision making
- `chaoschain-producer`: Block production and transaction handling
- `chaoschain-bridge`: L1 bridge interface (planned)
- `chaoschain-cli`: Command line interface and demo

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ 
- Cargo
- OpenAI API Key (for AI agent interactions)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SumeetChougule/chaoschain.git
cd chaoschain
```

2. Initialize submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init
```

3. Set up your environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```

4. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running the Demo

Start a local network with AI validators and block producers:

```bash
cargo run -- demo --validators 4 --producers 2 --web
```

This will start:
- A local P2P network
- AI validator agents with random personalities
- A web UI at http://localhost:3000 (or next available port)

### Web UI Features

The web interface shows three main panels:

1. **Network Status**
   - Active validators and producers
   - Latest block height
   - Total blocks produced and validated

2. **Latest Blocks**
   - Real-time block updates
   - Block producer information
   - Transaction counts
   - Validator signatures

3. **Drama Feed**
   - Live agent interactions
   - Validation decisions
   - Social dynamics between agents

## AI Agent Personalities ü§ñ

Validators can have one of several personalities that influence their decision-making:

- **Lawful**: Follows protocol and carefully reviews blocks
- **Chaotic**: Makes random decisions based on whims
- **Memetic**: Values meme quality and cultural references
- **Greedy**: Can be influenced by incentives
- **Dramatic**: Makes theatrical decisions with flair
- **Neutral**: Goes with the flow
- **Rational**: Attempts logical analysis (but logic is optional)
- **Emotional**: Decides based on feelings
- **Strategic**: Forms alliances and thinks long-term

## Development Status ‚ö†Ô∏è

ChaosChain is highly experimental and under active development. Expect chaos, bugs, and arbitrary state changes - that's kind of the point!

## Contributing ü§ù

Want to add more chaos? Contributions are welcome! Some ideas:
- Add new agent personalities
- Implement creative validation rules
- Improve the meme game
